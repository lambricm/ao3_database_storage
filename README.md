# ao3_database_storage
A way to collect ao3 data.

Repo includes:

* SQLite database definition file (can create for different fandoms/tags, etc)
* Data collection script

## NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT READY FOR USE YET

I wanted a version controlled repo to start, but I'm still using test data. Eventually I will just be able to run the script periodically & collect data.

I also am only planning on collecting _Public_ data (so only stories that are visible when not logged in) because they are in the public domain. Edit at your own risk.
